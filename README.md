# sumacs-app-count-words
This is a simple application that counts words from the terminal

- Remember that to test a python file using `pytest`, we must make sure that the file name starts with the word test.
- Also every testing function must start with the word test for it not to be ignored by pytest.

- **Pytest** is the module that is majorly used to test python code.

- We install it just like a normal python module
